## Ethereum -> Cosmos asset transfers

### Sending Ethereum assets to Cosmos via Lock

At this point you should have a running Cosmos SDK application, a running EVM chain and a running relayer. If any of those are missing from your setup please go back to the [README](../README.md) and setup whatever is missing.

With those three operations running we can lock our funds on the EVM chain contracts by sending a lock transaction containing Eth/ERC20 assets. First, we'll use default parameters to lock Eth assets.  

The EVM peggy commands come with the option of using a set of default parameter which are set in [sendLockTx.js](../testnet-contracts/scripts/sendLockTx.js) values which look as follows:

- [COSMOS_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS] = `cosmos1pjtgu0vau2m52nrykdpztrt887aykue0hq7dfh`
- [TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS] = `eth` (Ethereum has no token contract and is denoted by 'eth')
- [WEI_AMOUNT] = `10`

```bash
# Open a new terminal window

# Send lock transaction with default parameters
yarn peggy:lock --default
```

`yarn peggy:lock --default` expected output in Relayer console:

```bash

To make sure the event was relayed you can query the receiving cosmos account as follows:

```sh
ebcli q account cosmos1pjtgu0vau2m52nrykdpztrt887aykue0hq7dfh
```

### Testing ERC20 token support

The bridge supports the transfer of ERC20 token assets. We'll deploy a sample TEST token to the network and then use it to test the feature.

#### ERC20 token setup

If you've already deployed TEST tokens in the previous step with `yarn peggy:all`, skip the ERC20 token setup section.

```bash
# Mint 1,000 TEST tokens to your account for local use
yarn token:mint

# { TOKEN_AMOUNT: '10000000000000000000' }
# {
#   from: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
#   to: '0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57',
#   value: 10000000000000000000
# }

# Approve 100 TEST tokens to the Bridge contract
yarn token:approve --default

# You can also approve a custom amount of TEST tokens to the Bridge contract:
yarn token:approve 10000000000000000000

# {
#   owner: '0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57',
#   spender: '0x2C2B9C9a4a25e24B174f26114e8926a9f2128FE4',
#   value: 10000000000000000000
# }

# Get deployed TEST token contract address
yarn token:address
```

#### Sending ERC20 assets to Cosmos via Lock
```bash
# Put TEST tokens in the white list
# Note: crypto thief may use a token minted from a copy of a well-known Ethereum smart contract, so must white list to avoid it.
# ERC20 token white list requires 2 params
yarn peggy:whiteList [TEST_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS] true
```

```bash
# Lock TEST tokens on the Bridge contract
# Note: ERC20 token locking requires 3 custom params and does not support the --default flag
yarn peggy:lock [COSMOS_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS] [TEST_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS] [TOKEN_AMOUNT]
```

`yarn peggy:lock` ERC20 expected output in ebrelayer console (with a `TOKEN_AMOUNT` of 11):
